# wildfly-github-bot
wildfly-github-bot helps you to keep your pull requests in the correct format.

This project is build with usage of Quarkus GitHub App: https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-github-app/dev/index.html

## Development
###Step 1 - Register the application
After forking the project we need to register wildfly-github-bot on GitHub for your account. Go to [GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps) and click on `New GitHub Apps`

Also, you can access this page by clicking on your profile picture on gitHub and go to `Settings > Developer Settings > GitHub Apps > New GitHub App`.

Fields to fill in:

1. GitHub App name- should be unique
2. Homepage URL- the link to the forked project
3. Webhook URL
   - Go to [smee.io](https://smee.io/) and press `Start a new channel`
   - Add this link to `Webhook URL`
4. Set up permissions
   - `Commit statuses` - `Access: Read and write`
   - `Metadata` - `Access: Read-only`
   - `Pull requests` - `Access: Read and write`
5. Subscribe to events
   - `Pull requests`
   - `Pull request review comment`
6. Create a private key
   
    After creating the app scroll down and press `Generate a private key`

    You will be asked to download the key, keep it around, we will need it for the next stet.

###Step 2 - Set up the app 
As the configuration is environment-specific, and you probably donâ€™t want to commit it in your repository, the best is to create in the root a `.env` file.

The content of your .env file should be as follows:

```
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_APP_ID=<the numeric app id>
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_APP_NAME=<the name of your app>
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL=<your Smee.io channel URL>
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\
                  <your private key>                          \
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

**QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_APP_ID**
The numeric app id appearing in the App ID field.

**QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_APP_NAME**
The name of your app is the one appearing in the GitHub URL. It is only used to improve usability in dev mode.

**QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL**
The URL you obtained when you created your Smee.io channel.

**QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY**
The content of the private key you generated and downloaded. Open the key file with a text editor as key viewers usually only show fingerprints.

###Step 3 - Set up the app
1. Create a new repo or use an already created one in which you want to track PRs.
2. Go to the settings of your GitHub App and go to `Install App > Install > Only select repositories > Select the one you need > Install`
3. In your repo in the main branch create a folder `.github` and a file `wildfly-bot.yml` with xml code in it:
```
wildfly:
  rules:
    - title: "test"
    - body: "test"
      notify: [xstefank,petrberan]
  format:
    title-check:
      pattern: "\\[WFLY-\\d+\\]\\s+.*|WFLY-\\d+\\s+.*"
      message: "Wrong content of the title!"
    description:
      pattern: "JIRA:\\s+https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-\\d+|https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-\\d+"
      message: "The PR description must contain a link to the JIRA issue"
    commits-quantity:
      quantity: "1-3"
      message: "Too many commits in PR!"
```

1. `title-check`- Checks title of a PR by using regular expression in `pattern` field.
> The correct format in example is "[WFLY-11] Name"
2. `description`- Checks comment of a PR by using regular expression in `pattern` field.
> The correct format in example is "https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-11"
3. `commits-quantity`- Checks amount of commits in PR with amount in `quantity` field.
> In the field you can use an exact values '1', '2' or range '1-2', '2-4' up to 100.
4. `message` - The text of an error message in the respective check.

Also, there is a possibility to select checks, that you need. Just left in `wildfly-bot.yml` file checks you need.

Like this:
```
wildfly:
  rules:
    - title: "test"
    - body: "test"
      notify: [xstefank,petrberan]
  format:
    title-check:
      pattern: "\\[WFLY-\\d+\\]\\s+.*|WFLY-\\d+\\s+.*"
      message: "Wrong content of the title!"
```

### Run the application in dev mode
